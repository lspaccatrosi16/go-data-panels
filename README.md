# Go-Data-Panels

> Quick tree data panels for your go project with windows

## Why

Ever had some data produced by your go program that you wanted to display nicely? Fed up of going through console output trying to pick out what you need? This is the tool for you.

Organise related data in hierarchical trees so you don't have to do see everything at once, and organise these trees into different views so you only see what you want to see, with the rest a few keystrokes away.

## How do I get started?
